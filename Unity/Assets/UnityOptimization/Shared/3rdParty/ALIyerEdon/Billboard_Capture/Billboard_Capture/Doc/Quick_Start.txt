Hi

This package is for "Built-in RP" for default
The billboard capture tool works well on "URP"
"HDRP" is not supported
The billboard shaders are only for "Built-in RP" and "URP"

for URP you need to unzip urp shaders from the "Shaders" folder for your target unity version and delete the "Built-In RP" folder
